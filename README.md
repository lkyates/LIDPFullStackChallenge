## Requirements

This application uses Java 17. Note that you may have to configure Gradle's Java version explicitly, in addition to the global project's Java version.

## Repository Organization

At the top of the repository, you will find gradle configuration files and some files that are generated and required by Angular.

### /server

This directory holds the backend of the application. It includes web services and Spring Boot application setup files.

In the `/resources` directory you will find SQL files that are used to create and update the H2 database. The `/application.yml` file there configures the backend. Static resources are also stored here.

### /ui

This directory holds the frontend of the application. There are many files generated and required by Angular at the top of the directory.

In the `/app` directory you will find the static content of the frontend, typescript files to control it, and a way to call the endpoints that are hosted on the backend. Module organization also occurs here.

The `/assets` directory contains some static assets used by the application.

### /data

This is the default location that the H2 Database will store its persistent data and any stacktrace information.

## Starting the Application

To start the application, run or debug the `main` method in `ChallengeApplication.java`.

To host the frontend, run `ngServe` in `/ui/build.gradle` to serve the Angular content on the default port, 9090. The first time you run it may take extra time, as it will automatically run `npmInstall` for first-time setup.

The H2 embedded database does not have any content initially. After starting the application, you will need to go to `http://localhost:9690/h2-management-console/` and run `schema.sql` and `data.sql` from the `/server/src/main/resources` directory. After running these, you will be able to browse the data populated on the frontend. The H2 database is configured in `server/src/main/resources/application.yml`.

Once everything is up and running, you can access the application on `http://localhost:9090/`.
